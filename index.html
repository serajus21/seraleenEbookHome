			<h3>Is reading through online PDF is better than reading a book?</h3>
			<p>Definitely NOT!
				<br>
			Unless a book is filled with diagrams where the position of text in relation to the diagram is important, PDF is a terrible ebook format. The problem being that it is difficult to read without lots of scrolling in two directions on small screens. This makes for a clumsy e-reading experience. You are better off with a paper book. In fact the paper book was probably printed from a PDF document. That’s what PDF files are designed to do - be printed on paper.
				<br>
			The text won’t flow as its size is changed. Add to that that PDF files can be infected with malware; that’s one of the reasons why PDF is a favorite format on pirate book sites.
				<br>
			Reading EPUB or MOBI files - now that’s a different matter. They have lots of advantages over printed books.

			<h3>Will electronic books ultimately replace printed books in the future?</h3>
			<p>Nowadays, almost everywhere we go, we encounter people with tablets who are reading them. People prefer to use e-books, as they became trendy and convenient things for those who do not want to carry a big book. And to the question is, whether the e-books can replace paper books I would answer YES?

			First of all, let’s define what an “e-book” is. “E-book” is an electronic version of a printed book which can be read on a computer or a specially designed handheld device. People carry it everywhere, as it is precisely very convenient for those people who are busy all day, and have no time to go to a bookstore, or to carry many books around. The advantages of the e-book are many; It is straightforward and easy to purchase and download e-books through the Internet, no trees are required to manufacture paper for the pages of e-books and so forth. However, many people put into a question, whether they are as useful as paper books. Since the 1980s there have been hundreds of debates about what is actually better for the human brain: to read ink on the paper or to read from the screen of the tablet. More than a hundred investigations have been dedicated to this topic, and the results are diverse.

			Moreover, an interesting experiment has been applied to finally understand whether there is a difference between reading on a screen or a real book. A 2013 Norwegian study of the reading pattern showed that students who read a real, physical book scored much better in reading awareness than those who read texts digitally. This is connected with the fact that paper gives spatiotemporal markers; the touching of the paper and the act of shifting pages serve as memory markers that are absent while scrolling down an electronic screen. In two separate 2013 and 2014 studies, one of the school pupils and one of the grown-ups, Anne Mangenand, a professor at the University of Stavanger in Norway gave groups of people with similar reading skills several texts to read, with half reading electronic and half reading text on an actual paper. Afterward, the readers completed a test to gauge reading comprehension. Eventually, the people who read the texts electronically did worse than their paper reading counterparts.

			<h3> How do we work? </h3>
			<p> SeraLeen is a free search engine which allows you to search, preview and download millions of PDF files into your devices. Our crawlers are constantly scanning the world wide web to add PDF files to our database. In the case that PDF files are withdrawn from the web, then they are also immediately withdrawn from PDF Drive search results. In this way, our PDF Drive library stays up-to-date, while continuously growing and offering you an enormous database to search. In addition to the traditional search engines, PDF Drive has these extra features: </p>

			<h3> Objective? </h3>
			<p> The main objective of PDF is to share documents between different operating systems and devices. Creating, converting and exporting files was never an easy job. A few years back, sharing documents across multiple computer platforms was highly problematic. It is a widely used document format across the world.
