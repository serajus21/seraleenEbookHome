		<h3 style="text-align: center;"> Reading vs Watching Videos: What Science Says ? </h3>

			It is a fact; reading culture is being challenged on all fronts by new technology. These new technologies are challenging the predominance of books by presenting information in alternative ways.

			There was a time when books were the most reliable, most accurate, most convenient, and the most popular means of obtaining information. Their usefulness was what promoted a widespread reading culture.
			<br><br>
			Libraries, being the usual repository of books, were and are available in almost every town, and many homes usually have one. Book collections in homes and institutions were very common, and people learned exclusively from books.

			But today, the distinction that books enjoyed as the most popular repository of information and learning is being challenged with the proliferation of technologies such as videos and television (TV).

			No doubt, videos, and televisions have been around for a long time, but until this century, they haven’t been as easily obtainable as books. The ease of making videos and procuring them was engendered by the rise of digital devices and the internet.
			<br><br>
			Today, video collections on computers, smartphones, and tablets are very common. We can say that in today’s world, videos are increasingly challenging books and the reading culture. In fact, there are now individuals who have never collected books (physical or electronic) in their lives.

			We once examined a similar phenomenon in a previous article, but as exhaustive as that article was, it only talked exclusively about a war between two reading mediums: e-books and printed books.

			E-Books and printed books are only mediums for doing the same thing: reading. Video is another medium entirely, it conveys information in a way directly different from books. And it is getting widespread faster, so widespread that it is challenging reading as a popular means of obtaining information and learning.
			<br><br>
			But which is best for obtaining information and learning? Reading or watching videos (or watching TVs) ? Which does it better?

			To answer this question won’t be an easy task. Debates are already raging on the internet and off the internet on whether reading is still the best way to learn, or videos (which are now very common in learning situations) presents a better alternative.

			However, mass opinions can be confusing — proponents of reading and proponents of video equally have solid arguments to back up their preference.

			It is the reason why we will have to turn back to science to answer this question.

			Actually, the heading would have been more correctly presented as “What social science says…” rather than “What science says… “, this is because investigations like these fall mostly under the purview of the social sciences.

			Unlike physics and chemistry for example, where facts are derived from physical experiments using fixed and known variables, determining the benefits and harm of reading or watching videos on human beings can best be achieved by using tools from the social sciences: like surveys, interviews and studying feedbacks from sample groups of people over a long period of time; and they are the tools all reputable investigators of the problem have been using. Their conclusions are interesting.

			Is reading better than watching videos, or is watching videos better than reading? Let’s first hear what investigators who have researched both have to say, then we can safely pass our verdict. The main findings from their study can be summarized as:
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			<dl>
				<dt> <strong> Digital Method </strong> </dt>
				<dd> Students preferred to read digitally.</dd>
			</dl>
			<dl>
				<dt> <strong> Screens &gt; Prints </strong> </dt>
				<dd>Students judged their comprehension as better (online) with screens than with prints. </dd>
			</dl>
			<dl>
				<dt> <strong> Screens &lt; Prints </strong> </dt>
				<dd> The study actually shows that overall comprehension was better for print (reading) than with digital reading</dd>
			</dl>
		</p>
		<p style="text-align: center;">
			<cite>"It is very clear that, generally, (from the resources available to us), reading is better than watching video(s).
			If you have been struggling to cultivate the habit of reading, we think you should put in more effort to adopt it – using your free time to read good books will always be better than bingeing on TV shows.
			However, as information becomes overabundant for you (through books and videos)</cite>
