		<h3 style="text-align: center;"> Who was the first programmer ? </h3>
		<hr>
		<p>
			According to many people, the first computer programmer was the English noblewoman Ada Lovelace. In 1843, she published a sequence of steps to perform using a computing machine designed by her friend, Charles Babbage. These notes are considered the first computer program.

			<br><br> <hr>
			<p style="text-align: center;"> <cite> The program that Ada Lovelace wrote was for Charles Babbage's "Analytical Engine", a mechanical general-purpose computer he designed, but never completed. The design included memory, an arithmetic logic unit (processor), and control flow for looping. This means it would have had all of the key elements of a modern computer. 
			</p> </cite>
			<hr><br><br>
			In 1840, Charles Babbage gave a lecture about his computing machine in Italy. An Italian mathematician wrote a transcript of the lecture and published it. Ada Lovelace translated the article to English, and spent nine months writing additional notes about it. The notes were three times longer than the article. One section of the notes included a method to use Charles Babbage's machine to calculate Bernoulli numbers, a mathematical sequence. As a mathematician, they were a subject of interest to Ada. This method was an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine, which is the simplest description of a computer program.
			<br><br>
			Ada Lovelace was the child of the English poet George Lord Byron, though he left the country less than a year after she was born, and never returned. Her mother, Anne Milbanke, supported Ada's love of mathematics and science.

			Ada was born in 1815 as "The Honourable Augusta Ada Byron", and married William, 8th Baron King in 1835. William was made the Earl of Lovelace in 1838, making her the Countess of Lovelace. They had three children.

			The first electronic computers were not built until the 1940s, but the early work of Ada Lovelace was an important moment in the history of computers.

		<h3 style="text-align: center;">Did you know about ENIAC machine ? </h3>
		<p>
			ENIAC (/ˈɛniæk/; Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was the first programmable, electronic, general-purpose digital computer. It was Turing-complete and able to solve "a large class of numerical problems" through reprogramming.
			<br> <br>
			Although ENIAC was designed and primarily used to calculate artillery firing tables for the United States Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory (which later became a part of the Army Research Laboratory), its first program was a study of the feasibility of the thermonuclear weapon.

			ENIAC was completed in 1945 and first put to work for practical purposes on December 10, 1945.
			<br> <br>
			ENIAC was formally dedicated at the University of Pennsylvania on February 15, 1946, and was heralded as a "Giant Brain" by the press. It had a speed on the order of one thousand times faster than that of electro-mechanical machines; this computational power, coupled with general-purpose programmability, excited scientists and industrialists alike. The combination of speed and programmability allowed for thousands more calculations for problems, as ENIAC calculated a trajectory in 30 seconds that took a human 20 hours (allowing one ENIAC to displace 2,400 humans). 
			<br> <br>
			The completed machine was announced to the public the evening of February 14, 1946, and formally dedicated the next day at the University of Pennsylvania, having cost almost $500,000 (approximately equivalent to $7,283,000 in 2020). It was formally accepted by the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps in July 1946. ENIAC was shut down on November 9, 1946, for a refurbishment and a memory upgrade, and was transferred to Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland in 1947. There, on July 29, 1947, it was turned on and was in continuous operation until 11:45 p.m. on October 2, 1955.
