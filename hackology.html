		<h3 style="text-align: center;">First Hacker in the history !!!</h3>
		<p style="text-align: center;">
		<quotation>    	
			"The first major hacking came in 1971, by a vietnam vet named John Draper. He figured out a way to make free phone calls. This was later called "Phreaking". Abbie Hoffman followed John Drapers lead with "The Youth International Party Line" newsletter."

		<h3> It all began in MIT, USA !!! </h3>
		<p>
			Nowadays, different people have different views on the hacking scene. Often times people of similar skill level have similar opinions. There is no official definition of a hacker, rather a vague idea amongst the masses. In addition, the media loves to add false information to draw audiences’ attention across the nation, for the pure sake of money.

			It all began in the 1960s at MIT, origin of the term “hacker”, where extremely skilled individuals practiced hardcore programming in FORTRAN and other older languages. Some may ignorantly dub them “nerds” or “geeks” but these individuals were, by far, the most intelligent, individual, and intellectually advanced people who happen to be the pioneers and forefathers of the talented individuals that are today the true hackers. The true hackers amongst our societies have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Boredom is never an object of challenge for hackers. They have an almost anomalous ability to absorb, retain, and exert vast amounts of knowledge with regard to intricate details. In 1969, Bell Labs employee Ken Thompson invented UNIX and permanently changed the future of the computer industry. Then in the very early 1970s, Dennis Ritchie invented the computer programming language “C” which was specifically invented to be used with UNIX. Programmers ceased to use assembler, while developing an appreciation for the portability of “C.”

		<h3> Hacking into a communications system is nearly as old as communication systems themselves </h3>
		<p>
			Napoleon's semaphore telegraph, which used mechanical arms on towers that looked a bit like windmills to send coded signals across France, was hacked in 1834 by thieves seeking stock market information. Intercepted signals played a role in the American civil war: the Union and Confederate armies tapped each other's telegraph lines, and Confederate newspapers even published coded Union messages to try to crowdsource code-breaking.
			<br> <br>
			That interplay of offence and defence, invention and counter-invention, courses through the many meanings of the word hacking. The term dates back to 1955, when graduate students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) used it to mean, roughly, any creative trial-and-error experiments with a machine. Today, criminal hackers mount cyberattacks to enable identity theft, blackmail victims, or steal money with a click of a mouse.
			<br> <br>
			Yet "white-hat" hackers—or security experts hired to test IT weaknesses—are playing a bigger role in cybersecurity, finding and fixing vulnerabilities before the criminals spot them. "Hacking is trying to break things apart, put them back together, and creatively find solutions around limitations," says Rachel Tobac, CEO of SocialProof Security. "White-hat" hackers like her, says Ms Tobac, aim to “understand where the holes and gaps may be, so we can fix them and patch them."
			<br> <br>
			Often, the humans involved in a system, not the mechanisms, are the weak link. Modern offensive hacking started with the "phone phreaks" of the 1960s and 1970s, who gamed the US telephone system.

			Some discovered that they could make free long-distance phone calls by blowing a whistle into a phone at the high-pitched frequency of 2,600 hertz, to mimic an AT&T switching signal. Others befriended phone company operatives to learn their professional terminology, then used test numbers or operator assists, as a technician would, to avoid phone charges.
			<br> <br>
			In the 1980s hackers became infamous for breaking into computers via modems. The 1983 film WarGames, starring Matthew Broderick as a teenage hacker who nearly starts World War III, dramatised hacking, inspired it and fuelled a backlash. "War dialing" became the term for auto-dialing numbers to look for modems at government agencies, companies and bulletin board systems. The film even helped to inspire the US Congress to enact anti-hacking laws such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986. "Things [hackers] were doing to test the limitations of the system became something you could be jailed for," says Ms Tobac.

			Younger hackers are hard to classify. They're probably just as diverse as the old hackers are. We're all over the map.

			The difference between a hacker and consumer is a consumer says, "I wish it would work this way." A hacker says, "I've got a screwdriver and a few minutes.
